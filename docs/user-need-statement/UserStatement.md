# User Need Statement
This project is a project for the MSSA program.  The purpose of this project is the development of a system that will assist in player development by tracking and storing the stats and gears for players in a mobile massively multiplayer online role-playing game called Ragnarok Mobile.

This project accomplishes the following goals:

- Goal 1: Elicit and document project requirements
- Goal 2: Manage an interative design/implementation process
- Goal 3: Implement a web interface
- Goal 4: Integrate existing in-game equipment effects
- Goal 5: Mentor users on features

In the course of this project I will use ASP.NET and C# to build a user friendly web interface where individuals are able to submit their character data into a database and leaders in the guild are able query the collective data to track player development and growth over time.
